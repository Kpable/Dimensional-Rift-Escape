LD41 Dimensional Rift Escape
	For This jam, combine two incompatible genres, I chose shmups and escape rooms. I haven't played either in a long time but I've enjoyed them both and haven't made an effort to try making a game in either genre, so I took the challenge. 
What went wrong?
	I didnâ€™t have much info on escape rooms or the fundamentals of shmups. I definitely over scoped in trying to implement the basic mechanics of shmups and incorporating escape rooms design which from the minimal research I did for this, is very difficult. 
	
	I tried to follow a basic template I found online for the escape room in which the player finds clues and puts those clues to use to solve a specific puzzle in which the puzzle will provide a partial solution to the grand puzzle in this case the passcode to the reactor. In preliminary design the game started to feel more like an escape room instead of the shmup escape hybrid. So I have to reconsider the escape room design with the elements of a shmup. In trying to figure out how I could use shmup elements as clues/tools to solve the puzzles, it got tricky. 
	
	Too much planned to do, not enough time. Should've simplified the puzzles/clues, guns/enemies and gotten the design better worked out before hand.
	
What went right?

	The concept design came out pretty well I think. I like how the shmup gameplay was tied to the escape in that you cant just go off ignoring all the enemies to search for clues or investigate rubble. It gives the player a nudge saying hey you need to take care of these enemies and perhaps maybe these enemies can give you some clues.

What can we learn from the experience?

	Lack of knowledge on both genres really hurt here but it was fun to investigate ways to blend the two genres together. #noRegrets #camelCase 
	
	I would've liked to see the enemies play a bigger role. Perhaps a boss that would have sub parts that needed to be destroyed or the boss themselves drop a major clue on how to solve one of the puzzles. That way you're not mindlessly shooting enemies for no reason. 
	
	The concept for space station rubble had potential as well, such as having indoor corridors with different enemy types like lasers, or turrets. It also would've been nice to be able to dive into some more of the story. What happened before you get there, why did you have to warp away, why was  space station in a pocket dimension? So many questions. 

Future Ideas/Current bugs
- Reactor ship
  - Have turrets on it protecting the runes. Have player disable them first some how
- Camera needs to stop lerping on warp, potentially 9way ghost? 
- Have meteors split off into smaller meteors
- Show meteors and rubble taking damage. 
- Rubble/meteors contribute to reactor strain?
- Text too high up. 
- Make smaller debris less impactful
- Fix player physics so they aren't infinitely moving after being hit by a pebble
- Player shows damage being taken.
- Enemies show damage being taken
- Save/implement High score in points 
- Save/implement High score in time
- Space array nodes further apart for easier travel
- Finish puzzle designs/implementation
- Implement beam reflection off reflective surfaces. And shield?
- Incorporate weapons into puzzle solving
- Makes weapons scrollable once obtained?
- Fight bosses to get weapon upgrades?
- Different weapon definitions.
- Fix beam cannon. 
- Make enemies smarter
- Rune password, last entry that resets them stays pressed
- Additional shmup tools, like bombs, dash maybe
- Implement collapse
- Power up drop the right way instead of just floating. 
- Indoor corridors?
